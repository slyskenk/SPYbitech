Prerequisites ✅
Make sure you have these installed:

Node.js (v18 or higher recommended) 🟢

npm (Node Package Manager) 📦

PostgreSQL database 🐘

Installation 🚀
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install express @google/generative-ai cors dotenv pg bcryptjs body-parser
(Note: This single command installs all the necessary packages for your project.)

Set up environment variables:

Create a file named .env in your project's root directory.

⚠️ Security Tip: Never commit your .env file to Git! Add .env to your .gitignore to keep your sensitive data private.

Add your environment variables to the .env file, like this:

Ini, TOML

PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
GOOGLE_GEN_AI_API_KEY=your_google_generative_ai_api_key
Database Setup 🐘

Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.

Use a tool like pgAdmin or the psql command line to create the necessary tables for your application. Here's an example schema for a users table:

SQL

CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Run the Application ▶️

Start your backend server with:

Bash

node index.js
(Replace index.js with the name of your main server file.)

How to Get Your API Key 🔑
Google Generative AI API
Go to Google AI Studio and log in with your Google account.

Click Get API key to create a new key.

Copy the generated key.

Paste it into your .env file next to GOOGLE_GEN_AI_API_KEY.
